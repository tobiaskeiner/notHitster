# Welcome to notHitster 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

NotHitster is a simple App, which allows you to guess your favourite Music. It generates the QR-Codes to play your music.

## Prerequisites

You need the App [QRSong!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.rickgroenewegen.qrsong) for scanning the generated QR Codes and playing the music.

## How to play

1. Start the app and login to spotify
2. Allow the app to access your data (only personal and public playlists are read)
3. Copy the url of the playlist you want to guess music for
4. Paste the url of a Spotify Playlist into the Text Input
5. Click the "Get tracks" button, so that the app can get all tracks of the playlist from Spotify
6. Start the game
7. Use the App QRSong! to play the music
